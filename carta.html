    <h2><b>Re: Eileen Dover university application</b></h2>
    <p>Dear Eileen,<br><br>
    Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part<br>
    of your <u>PhD</u> next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>
    <section>
        <h3><b>Starting dates</b></h3>
        <p>We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you<br>
            could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
            <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
            <li>Third semester 2 May 2017</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please let me know if this is ok. and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>
        <p>You can find more information about <a href="#">important university dates</a> on our website.</p>

        <h3><b>Subjects of study</b></h3>
        <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall<br>somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just<br>the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued<br>by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Rcsveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
            <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplaycrs at tcmpraturcs exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the<br>audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> > 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
            <li><u>HTML</u> and <u>CSS</u> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the<br>research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>

        <h3><b>Exotic dance moves</b></h3>
        <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work. I <i>did</i> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question,<br>my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
            <dd>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300<u>BC</u>. a whole village would dance around<br>in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be "fruitful".</dd>
            <br>
            <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
            <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which<br>involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in impcccptably<br>tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired<br>modem styles such as Twerking.</dd>
            <br>
            <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
            <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation. English explorers in the 1960s believed to have<br>discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants<br>of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this<br>because they were really cold.</dd>       
        </dl>

    <p>Yours sincerely.</p>
